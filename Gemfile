# A sample Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'sinatra'
gem 'thin'
gem 'require_all'
gem 'activerecord', '5.2'
gem 'sinatra-activerecord'
gem 'rake' 

group :development do
	gem 'shotgun'
	gem 'pry'
	gem 'tux'
    gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.3.6' 
end

# tthe added gems to the development group; it's what allows our Ruby application to communicate with a SQL database. 
#tux will give us an interactive console that 
# pre-loads our database and ActiveRecord relationships for us. Since we won't use either of these in production, we put 
# them in our :development group - this way, they won't get installed on our server when we deploy our application.
